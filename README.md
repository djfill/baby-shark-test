# Baby Shark Test
A scripting exercise that has nothing to do with the really annoying song (named as such because I couldn't get it out of my head at the time).

## Prerequisites
Bash Shell terminal and Python2.7
This was done on Mac OS X El Capitan

## Set up
1. Clone this repository
2. cd baby-shark-test

## The exercise
Under the assets directory is a subset of folders 1-10.  
In each of these folders is an asset in the form of a jpeg (the files are actually empty).  
The (pretend) assets are incorrectly named and you need to rename them to their correct values.  
In baby-sharks.csv are the corresponding folder names, incorrect names and correct names per row.  
Your task is to write a script to rename the assets to their correct 'baby' names (because the pretend assests are really pictures of cute babies not nasty sharks)  
Solve this using either Bash or Python. You can use Powershell but beware of the encoding of the csv file.  

### Solution
There are two solutions included in the repository:   
solution.sh  
solution.py  

### Resetting the exrecise
There are two shell scripts. One to delete all of the assets and one to create all of the assets should you need to.
